not creating lines correctly, they seem not to associate with the right sectors
add comment to items to identify and then watch as they resolve

doom Y coordinates are different from standard
output map doesn't display right in Doom but its not clear what's wrong. Doom Builder is able to correct it, but not clear what it's doing.
Add an "Annotator" service to write comments to lines to get a better idea what's going wrong

map is mysteriously "ok" now even without changes. might have involved changing namespace, but even going back to original, still displays.

* door generation must be tested from each direction

* unpeg doortracks
* texture handling object - including pegs, x/y offset

* find a way to tell if a line is facing the proper direction
this will involve checking if a point is inside the sector
to do this, we need to know which lines are the outside and which lines might be inner pillars
group vertices into closed loops
figure out if each group is a void or the sector
look up "point in polygon" function to determine if point is in main sector and NOT in any voids

7/21/2025
checking if a polygon is a void or not doesn't seem to work
need a different way. a void is always going to be inside the main sector. two voids will never overlap
so if it overlaps another polygon, then  the smaller one must be a void

point in sector and line flip is working
stairs still needs work. walls missing front sidedef. Also need different, unique sector at end of stair or else ceiling height will be wrong.

7/23/2025
walls for stairs not merging properly. facing wrong direction and marked as two sided

7/26/2025
stairs and lifts are working
