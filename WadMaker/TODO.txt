not creating lines correctly, they seem not to associate with the right sectors
add comment to items to identify and then watch as they resolve

doom Y coordinates are different from standard
output map doesn't display right in Doom but its not clear what's wrong. Doom Builder is able to correct it, but not clear what it's doing.
Add an "Annotator" service to write comments to lines to get a better idea what's going wrong

7/9/2025
map is mysteriously "ok" now even without changes. might have involved changing namespace, but even going back to original, still displays.

7/17/2025
* door generation must be tested from each direction

7/19/2025
* unpeg doortracks
* texture handling object - including pegs, x/y offset

7/20/2025
* find a way to tell if a line is facing the proper direction
this will involve checking if a point is inside the sector
to do this, we need to know which lines are the outside and which lines might be inner pillars
group vertices into closed loops
figure out if each group is a void or the sector
look up "point in polygon" function to determine if point is in main sector and NOT in any voids

7/21/2025
checking if a polygon is a void or not doesn't seem to work
need a different way. a void is always going to be inside the main sector. two voids will never overlap
so if it overlaps another polygon, then  the smaller one must be a void

7/22/2025
point in sector and line flip is working
stairs still needs work. walls missing front sidedef. Also need different, unique sector at end of stair or else ceiling height will be wrong.

7/23/2025
walls for stairs not merging properly. facing wrong direction and marked as two sided

7/26/2025
stairs and lifts are working

7/28/2025
texture offset handling: test on room with walls not 128 units wide, assert lines given proper offset
add part with upper and lower, ensure textures properly pegged
lifts and doors should NOT be pegged+

7/31/2025
add alcoves and ensure upper/lower textures aligned with main wall

8/2/2025
step should not be unpegged (how though?)
prevent theme from applying to doortrack
	use a placeholder texture and only apply theme when texture is placeholder
step texture must only apply to lower texture

----BREAK 

8/31/2025

test ammo not placed in void
update formation to place in square groups

create a map for ammo placement testing

better looking ammo placement
	create test map with alcoves, pillars, and side rooms
		ensure ammo not placed into void
		ensure ammo not placed on tall pillars
	place ammo in groups
	move ammo to proper positions

	do we need to fully build the map to know where we can place things?
		think we can do it by the room shape alone...

	include larger ammo type

9/7 full map test notes
* issue creating stairs when start/end were 0

CRITICAL:
* no switch sound (caused by having an upper texture)

NICE TO HAVE:
* exit switch auto-align
* better texture placement

current issue is because we assume the back side of an inner sector belongs to the parent

while we are repairing overlapping linedefs, some sectors might become incomplete while we are still processing.
instead of replacing lines as we go, we need to create a map of lines that need replacing with the lines that will
replace them, and process them all at once.

---- 9/17
"replace all at once" doesn't work because there are often multiple overlaps at once
we still want to do it one at a time, but we have to keep the original lines and sectors around for bounds checking
